### Experiment 8
# Programs based on Advanced Plotting Techniques

#### 8.1 Subplots
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Creates a figure with two subplots, the first subplot, plots a sine wave, the second subplot, plots a cosine wave.
- Represent the sine and Cosine waves as two graphs in the same figure
- Adds titles, labels, and legends to the plots.

#### 8.2 3D Plotting
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Generates a mesh grid of ‘x’ and ‘y’ values.
- Computes z=sin(√(x 2 +y 2 )).
- Creates a 3D surface plot, line and scatter plot of ‘z’.
- Adds titles, labels, and color bar.

#### 8.3 3D Plotting
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Plots a sphere [x(t,s),y(t,s),z(t,s)]=[cos(t)cos(s),cos(t)sin(s),sin(t)] where [t,s]=[0,2pi]
- Adds titles, labels, and proper titles.
