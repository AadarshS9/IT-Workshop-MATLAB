### Experiment 7
# Programs based on scripts and user-defined functions

#### 7.1 Simple Script and Function
Write a MATLAB script that:
- To read the range
- Print all the prime numbers with in a range.

#### 7.2 Write a MATLAB script that:
- Reads a number
- Check of the number is a Pythagorean triplet using function
- Hint:The set of numbers (3, 4, 5) is called a Pythagorean triple, meaning the three positive integers satisfy the equation: a^2 +b^2 =c^2

#### 7.3 Function to Compute Fibonacci Sequence
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Defines a function fibonacci to compute the first ‘n’ terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
- Prompts the user to enter ‘n’, calls the function, and displays the sequence
