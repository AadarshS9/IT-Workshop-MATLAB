### Experiment 2
# Vectors and Matrices: Programs using array operations and matrix operations

#### 2.1 Vector Operations
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Creates two vectors A=[1,2,3] and B=[4,5,6].
- Computes and displays the dot product and cross product of vectors ‘A’ and ‘B’.

#### 2.2 Matrix Operations
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Creates two matrices M1=[1,2;3,4] and M2=[5,6;7,8].
- Performs and displays the result of matrix multiplication M1×M2,inverse of M1,Transpose of M2,matrix concatenation, Determinant of M2
