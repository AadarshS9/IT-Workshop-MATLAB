### Experiment 9
# Programs based on two main data structures: cell arrays and structures

#### 9.1 Cell Array Manipulation
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Has the cell array C = {3.14, &#39;MATLAB&#39;, true; 7, [1 2 3], &#39;hello&#39;}
- Access and display the second element of the first row.
- Replace the third element of the second row with a new matrix [4 5 6].
- Modify the content of the first cell to store a structure containing information about a student (name, age, GPA). Display the updated cell array.

#### 9.2 Structures
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Defines a structure array to store information about three students, including fields for Name, Age, and marks of 4 subjects.
- Adds data for each student.
- Computes and displays the average grade of each student along with name. Generate a ranklist and store it in another structure and display it.
