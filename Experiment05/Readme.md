### Experiment 5
# Loop Statements and Vectorizing Code: Programs based on counted (for) and conditional (while) loops

#### 5.1 Summation using For Loop
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Computes the sum of the first ‘n’ natural numbers using a for loop, where ‘n’ is provided by the user.
- Displays the result as matrix.

#### 5.2 Factorial Calculation using While Loop
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Computes the factorial of a number ‘n’ using a while loop, where ‘n’ is provided by the user.
- Displays the result.

#### 5.3 Vectorized Operations
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Creates a vector x=[1,2,3,…,10]
- Computes and displays the square of each element in the vector using vectorized operations.
