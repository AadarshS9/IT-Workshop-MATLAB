### Experiment 1
# Programs using mathematical, relational expressions, and operators

#### 1.1 Basic Mathematical Operations
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Defines two variables ‘a’ and ‘b’ with values 5 and 3, respectively.
- Computes and displays the sum, difference, product, and quotient of ‘a’ and ‘b’.
- Uses relational operators to compare ‘a’ and ‘b’ and displays the results of the comparisons (e.g., a&gt;b, a==b, etc.).

#### 1.2 Complex Mathematical Expressions
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Defines three variables x=2, y=4, and z=6.
- Computes the value of the expression f(x,y,z)=x 2 +y 2 −z 2 +√xy and displays the result.
