- Prompts the user to enter a score (0-100).
- Uses if-else and elseif statements to classify the score into grades (A, B, C, D, F) and displays the corresponding grade.

 #### 4.2 Quadratic Equation Calculator
 Write a MATLAB script that:
 - Prompts the user to enter the coefficients of the quadratic equation and calculate the roots Using Switch Statement

####  4.3 Switch Statement
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Prompts the user to enter the choice (to calculate the area or perimeter)and the radius of the circle
- Uses a switch statement to perform the corresponding operation and displays the result.
