### Experiment 11
# Programs based on Image Processing

#### 11.1 Basic Image Manipulation
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Reads an image file.
- Converts the image to grayscale.
- Displays the original and grayscale images side by side.

#### 11.2 Edge Detection
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Reads an image file.          
- Converts the image to grayscale.              
- Applies different edge detection algorithm to the image.            
- Displays the original image and all the edge-detected image side by side.

#### 11.3 Image scaling
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Reads an image file.          
- Converts the image to grayscale.              
- Implement a custom function that processes the image pixel by pixel and computes the average of the neighboring pixels repalcing each pixel of an image with the average value of its four nearest neighbors (top, bottom, left, and right).
- The border pixels need not be processed because they do not have four neighbors.
