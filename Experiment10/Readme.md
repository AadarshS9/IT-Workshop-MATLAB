### Experiment 10
# Programs based on Advanced Functions

#### 10.1 Anonymous Functions and Function Handles
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Defines an anonymous function to compute the square of a number.
- Creates a function handle to the anonymous function.
- Uses the function handle to compute and display the square of a user-provided number.

#### 10.2 Nested Functions
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Defines a main function to compute the area of a rectangle.
- Within the main function, defines a nested function to compute the perimeter of the rectangle.
- Prompts the user for the length and width of the rectangle.
- Call the nested function to compute the perimeter and the main function to compute the area, then displays both results.
