### Experiment 6
# Programs on Built-in text manipulation functions and conversion between string and number types

#### 6.1 Text Manipulation
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Prompts the user to enter a string.
- Converts the string to uppercase and lowercase.
- Displays the results.

#### 6.2 String to Number Conversion
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Prompts the user to enter a numerical string.
- Converts the string to a number.
- Performs an arithmetic operation (e.g., adds 10 to the number) and displays the result.

#### 6.3 Counting Vowels in a String
Write a MATLAB script that:
- Prompts the user to enter a string.
- Uses built-in functions to count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.
- Displays the count of each vowel.
